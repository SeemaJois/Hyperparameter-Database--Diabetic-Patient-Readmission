# Hyperparameter-Database--Diabetic-Patient-Readmission

Readmission of patients at a hospital is a significant worry in diabetes. In terms of money over 250 million dollars was spent on tending the readmitted diabetes patients in the year 2011. Premature recognition of patients that face a high risk of readmission can permit healthcare providers to perform a supplemental inspection and feasible prevention of further admissions. In the year 2011, it was announced that over 3.3 million patients were readmitted in the US within 30 days of being discharged and this was associated with about $41 billion in Hospital Bills. The requirement of readmission indicates that deficient care was provided to the patients at the time they were first admitted. The readmission rate has become an important measure that measures the comprehensive quality of a Hospital. The statistical metric for readmission status is AUC. Our objective here is to find the important hyperparameters and their range, along with their comparison across different algorithms. In order to show the obtained solution is optimal, we have included exploratory analyses of the dataset and conducted rigorous validation and optimization of hyperparameter using H2O.
